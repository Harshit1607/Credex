## 💡 Why This Theme?

I chose this theme because the **color palette is minimal yet visually appealing**. The accent color `#BE4564` (a pinkish-red) adds personality without overwhelming the design. The overall look stays professional, modern, and tech-focused — just right for a startup like SoftSell.
